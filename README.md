# K-Means-Algorithm
This is a class I put together as an exercise in programming manchine learing algorithms. The methods here work with 2D Numpy arrays, as these are extremely fast for matrix manipulation. 

With this class, you can cluster items with `Train.KMeansClustering()` and then pass the generated cluster centroids to `Train.NearestNeighborClassifier()` to classify unseen data. The latter is essentially a K Nearest Neighbor algorithm with k=1.

A working demonstration of the class is shown in `run_k-means_on_20-newsgroups-dataset.ipynb`, where I cluster documents from the [20 Newsgroups data set](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/). The clusters generated by `Train.KMeansClustering()` allow for classification with `Train.NearestNeighborClassifier()` on an unseen test set. This demonstration validates the machine learning algorithms via a high test-set classification accuracy of 82.50%.
