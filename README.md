# K-Means-Algorithm
This is a set of vectorized algorithms that uses a document-term numpy array to create K-Means cluster centroids and cluster assignments. 
These functions will allow you to cluster your documents, then use the model centroids in a classifer algorithm to classify unknown 
documents.
