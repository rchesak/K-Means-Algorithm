# K-Means-Algorithm
Contents: K Means Clustering Algorithm, K Means Model Classifier, Random Cluster Centroid Generator, and similarity functions

This is a set of hand-built, Numpy vectorized algorithms that use a document-term numpy array to create K-Means cluster centroids and cluster assignments. 
These functions will allow you to cluster your documents, then use the model centroids in a classifer algorithm to classify unknown 
documents.
